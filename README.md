This code has taken and unzipped the data first off,using an if statement provided the files exist

we have then created variables, by reading in from the file UCI HAR Dataset that we unzipped

we have then created two other variables, x and y, and using the rbind function on some of the variables we obtained from reading in the file

Following this. we have created 3 tables, Merged, Tidy, and Final data, before using the strfunction to print the Final Data table to the console
